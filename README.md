That's news web app pet-project I've made to learn basics of React and Redux, also how to compile apps with Webpack. Itâ€™s SPA, compiled by my own on Webpack, written on React with Hooks in a bundle with Redux, for handling asynchronous events I chose React-Redux. Styles written on SASS in scss syntax. Adapted for mobile devices.
